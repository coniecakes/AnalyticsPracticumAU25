📌 Overview<br>

The Analytics Practicum is a graduate-level experiential learning course designed to bridge the gap between academic analytics knowledge and real-world application. Participants work as analytics consultants, collaborating with client organizations to solve complex business challenges using data-driven approaches.

This practicum emphasizes strategic thinking, hands-on data analysis, and stakeholder communication, preparing students to tackle real-world problems in industries ranging from finance and healthcare to marketing and operations.
